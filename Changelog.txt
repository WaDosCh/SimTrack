In development:
	- See: https://github.com/WaDosCh/SimTrack/issues

v0.3.2
	- added isHeadless/ isMovable properties to WindowComponent
	- positioning for Windows on DesktopComponent
	- add money to the game
	- merge Navigator and ViewPort since they are both responsible for scrolling/zooming -> ViewPortNavigator
	- clean dependencies between classes. remove multiple getter methods where controller objects are passed around
	  Game now injects required dependencies into classes in constructor.
	- delete save from loadgame menu
	- add visibility flag to WindowComponents
	- fix mirror not working when building tracks (tab focus traversal keys disabled)
	- treat DebugTools and InputGuide as UI Windows not as GameTools as before
	- treat saveGame, mainMenu all as UIWindow not as GameTool
	- reuse loadGame dialog ingame as window
	- fix selecting build tool shows track shortly at a wrong position (last position when build tool was selected)
	- add track costs and subtract when player builds something
	- construction only possible if budget >= cost
	- removing tracks has a cost
	- add bounty when train reaches destination
	- resize DesktopComponents when ui size is changed (newly open windows are centered again)

	- ingame menus render dark overlay over rest/map

	- screenshots tagged with version name
	- scene load/unload with default methods instead of reflectionUtilHelpers
	- updated Profiler with object based interface instead of working with indices
	- render method without scene parameter
	- tick without scene parameter (simpler interface, controller must already have dependencies)
